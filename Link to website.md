# Countries Flag Display Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the JavaScript code that fetches data from a REST API containing information about countries and their flags. The fetched data is then used to dynamically create and display card components for each country's flag and information on a web page.

## Introduction

The provided JavaScript code focuses on utilizing asynchronous programming concepts to fetch data from the "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all" REST API. This data contains details about various countries, including their flags and regions. The code then uses this data to dynamically generate HTML card components, each representing a country's flag and information.

## Setup

- **Root Container:** A root container (`divRoot`) is created as a `div` HTML element and appended to the `body` of the document. This container will hold the generated card components.

## Functions

### getData

The `getData` function is an asynchronous function that fetches data from the specified API endpoint using the `fetch` API. It then parses the response as JSON and returns the fetched data.



countriesFlag
The countriesFlag function is responsible for populating the root container with card components for each country. It uses the getData function to fetch the data and then iterates through each country's data to dynamically create card components with flag images and information.



```javascript
async function getData() {
  // ... (code content)
}


Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Ensure the HTML file has a <body> tag to append elements to.
Place the provided JavaScript code within a <script> tag in the HTML file, after the <body> tag.
Conclusion
The provided JavaScript code demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming concepts to fetch and display country data using dynamically generated card components. By using the getData function for fetching and the countriesFlag function for rendering, the code achieves efficient data retrieval and a visually appealing user interface for displaying country flags and information.
